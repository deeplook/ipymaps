# IPyMaps

This repository hosts a somewhat experimental project aiming to build a configurable map-based search interface sitting on the shoulders of [ipyleaflet](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet). IPyMaps basically provides a a search text field and a controller for it to be added to a normal map widget. For now the controller provides geocoding and querying features (for OSM and WikiData so far), resulting in an interface *somewhat* reminescent of Google Maps and friends. This map widget is also showcased in the [Voila Gallery](https://voila-gallery.org/), created with the excellent [voila](https://github.com/QuantStack/voila) dashboarding tool.
