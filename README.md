# IPyMaps

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/deeplook/ipymaps/master?filepath=ipymaps.ipynb)

This is a dedicated repository to host a somewhat experimental project aiming to build a configurable map-based search interface sitting on the shoulders of [ipyleaflet](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet), and somewhat reminescent of Google Maps and friends. It first started as a notebook inside a [fork](https://github.com/deeplook/voila) of [voila](https://github.com/QuantStack/voila). This map widget is also showcased in the [Voila Gallery](https://voila-gallery.org/services/gallery/).
